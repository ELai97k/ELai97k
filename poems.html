			How the rivers divide <br>
			Between you and I <br>
			How can we get by <br>
			Without a heavy sigh <br><br>
			Let the music play <br>
			Our solemn song of sorrow <br>
			Until the night fades away, we'll rise up tomorrow
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 2-->
			Where have I gone wrong? <br>
			What have I done wrong? <br>
			It's not your fault, and you say it's not my fault either. <br>
			But hopefully there is, and will be, nothing lost that cannot be gained between us. <br>
			I could go on growing, or wither. <br>
			Until the day we both return to the dust.
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 3-->
			Under the lonely tree, I sat down weeping for you. <br>
			My sorrows stretch out as far as a winding river. <br>
			Beyond the the horizon, it goes into the oceans of bittersweet memories yonder.
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 4-->
			How I wish you were mine <br>
			But alas, this was never meant to be <br>
			My heart aches for you <br>
			I long to be closer to you still <br>
			But alas, this was never meant to be <br>
			Our forbidden love is etched in the night sky <br>
			Like the stars, it's up there but can never be reached
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 5-->
			If only I could forget, <br>
			Then the pain would be bearable. <br>
			If only I'd stop much sooner, <br>
			Then my regrets would be lessened. <br>
			If only there were no bond between us, <br>
			Then there wouldn't be a heavy one-sided yoke of burdens.
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 6-->
			My shining sun, my glittering star <br>
			No matter how far you are <br>
			You will always be near in my heart
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 7-->
			Sleep is not eternal <br>
			But my soul longs for the inferno <br>
			Away into the dead of night <br>
			I collapsed under the sheer weight of the fist fight <br>
			When I awoke in the heavenly stardom <br>
			I have finally achieved enlightenment in my freedom
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 8-->
			Was it all worth it? <br>
			Only for you to leave and never return? <br>
			Across the endless oceans, will you forget me? <br>
			I may be uable to keep you close, but my heart still longs for warmth and embrace. <br>
			Yet it always remains firm and strong amidst chaos and destruction. <br>
			Time does not wait for anyone, it has no regard for human sorrows and goodbyes. <br>
			Even if our fated end comes, the universe goes on, without a care for mere mortals. <br>
			We are but fickle shadows doomed to live and die.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 9-->
			I was a fool to put too much faith in you, <br>
			Only for you to receive but never give back. <br>
			But it wasn't you who broke me. <br>
			I broke myself to pieces, and had to repair and rebuild. <br>
			But in the reflections of the broken glasses, I saw all my faults and wrongs. <br>
			So I put myself back, but I'm still broken and fragile, as I've always been. <br>
			Scars and cracks won't go away, but the heart continues to beat. <br>
			Until the day it stops.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 10-->
			My heart is heavy <br>
			I'm unable to see what's in front of me <br>
			But one thing I can see <br>
			Is your reflection etched into the deep sea
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 11-->
			Up high on the mountain top, <br>
			I saw my world below me. <br>
			Life goes on. <br>
			People eat, drink, and be merry. <br>
			Life is a dreary thought, so I flew away. <br>
			Reaching out for the heavens, never to return again.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 11-->
			When the storm fades away tonight. <br>
			A new light of hope will dawn upon us. <br>
			But only if we face the deep dark abyss. <br>
			What will become of us if we come out alive? <br>
			Joy? Or even more grief and despair? <br>
			Or can happiness ever be achieved? <br>
			Until the bitter end of our lives, we must continue to stand strong, <br>
			in the deep dark abyss.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 12-->
			In the heat of the moment, <br>
			I cared a little bit too much. <br>
			In the heat of the moment, <br>
			I wonder what will become of me, <br>
			If I express the unexplainable cries of my spirit. <br>
			In my deep, uncaring silence, <br>
			I found myself unable to feel anything anymore. <br>
			Life is all for naught, time delivers us all to the same end. <br>
			Our hearts falter, and our minds become hellish shadows for all to fear. <br>
			No one is good. But even if they are, it doesn't matter. <br>
			One day, we will return to the shadows, never to be seen again by all. <br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 13-->
			I'm cold and cannot breathe, <br>
			As I anticipate your return. <br>
			How I wish you could be mine, <br>
			But if we were never meant to be together, <br>
			Then why did our meeting still happen? <br><br>

			How strange it is, <br>
			When God placed us to cross each other's paths, <br>
			But yet, we were never meant to be together at all. <br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 14-->
			I've always known about many things, <br>
			Appearances are deceiving, human strength fails again and again, <br>
			Because of our naturally evil nature. <br>
			No one is good; there is no one good, except God. <br>
			Though many believe He has forsaken us in this world, <br>
			Yet some of our souls long for something far beyound our power and understanding.<br>
			A higher power beyond the universe, and they call Him God.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 15-->
			Sticks and stones will break me, <br>
			But I've shattered myself long before they did. <br>
			When you reach the peak, you will go downhill again. <br>
			This is the curse of life ever since we came into this world. <br>
			But yet there is joy and wonder when we come to understand each other. <br>
			Blessings and curses come our way, but at the end of the day, <br>
			We all have one duty in life. <br>
			Have reverence for God and obey His laws placed for us. <br>
			Remember Him our Creator before we all crawl back to dust, <br>
			And return to the deep dark grave, <br>
			Never to be seen again. <br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 16-->
			On our final day together, <br>
			I hope that you and I will remember, <br>
			All our good and bad times. <br>
			And once we're apart, we'll be fine. <br>
			You and I will be set free, <br>
			And if we see each other again, we'll smile silently. <br><br>

			I'm glad to have met you, <br>
			Let our meeting someday be renewed. <br>
			If we're ever lost, <br>
			Let us not freeze in the frost. <br><br>

			Healing is painful and it hurts, <br>
			Life is an endless journey in the desert. <br>
			I hope to find you and me again, <br>
			If not, let our tears and goodbyes be refrained.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 17-->
			It's amazing when they still care, <br>
			Otherwise I'd be long gone in my own warfare. <br>
			I can't wait to be set free. <br>
			I'd like to stand and dance in the breeze. <br>
			Through the prayers of all, I can win. <br>
			However, there still lies the temptations of sin. <br>
			If I can have the strength to conquer it all, <br>
			Have the power to break down the wall, <br>
			Make it through the shadows of the night, <br>
			Then one day, there will be no more fight or flight. <br>
			Calm and peace will be finally upon us, <br>
			And there shall be eternal blessings, and no more endless curse. <br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 18-->
			Farewell to you, dear friend. <br>
			Seems that our world is coming to an end. <br>
			Are my words still left unsaid? <br>
			Or would it make you feel afraid? <br>
			When the sun sets, the moon will rise. <br>
			As we grow to survive, we become wise. <br>
			Seasons come and go, there is a time for everything. <br>
			Even in this world, our fragile lives are temporary.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 19-->
			If you can't be mine, <br>
			I'll be fine. <br>
			I wish I could tell you what's on my mind. <br>
			I hope that our love would still be alive. <br><br>

			I'd like to know what you think of me. <br>
			I want to be with you every time. <br>
			But do you feel and think the same? <br>
			And if you don't, I'll just take my leave and be gone.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 20-->
			How do I care for you?<br>
			How can I show my love for you?<br>
			If you can't even be mine.<br>
			But I hope and pray that they will treat you well.<br>
			If they can make you happy, then I'll be glad for you too.<br><br>

			We are like the east and the west.<br>
			So far apart, and shining in separation.<br>
			I'm unable to express what's inside of me.<br>
			I am afraid of sharing my true feelings.<br>
			Lest I be rejected, and break myself to pieces.<br>
			And put myself to shame, fully enduring the punishment.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 21-->
			The thought of you leaving me, is a pain too much to ponder.<br>
			I'd be a heartless fool, if I leave you too.<br>
			They say learn to be alone.<br>
			One day, everyone will disappear.<br>
			Yes I know. But I also know,<br>
			Just how much my inexpressible pain is hidden inside.<br><br>

			The thought of you leaving me, is a pain too much to ponder.<br>
			I'd be a heartless fool, if I leave you too.<br>
			It will hurt me so much, if you leave me.<br>
			It hurts to be alone.<br><br>

			Sometimes I wish I never existed.<br>
			If only there was a world, with just you and me.<br>
			Together forever.<br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 22-->
			The days crawl by slowly<br>
			When you're in pain<br>
			Longing for something impossible to achieve<br>
			Dreaming for something that won't come true<br>
			Wishing to be near you<br>
			But your heart and mind is on something else<br>
			Something beyond my own self <br>
			Someone that I cannot become<br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 23-->
			I was in pain all night,<br>
			But when you came into sight,<br>
			My heart burst in blissful delight.<br><br>

			People can see what's in me,<br>
			But I cannot see anything valuable in my identity.<br>
			All I see in me is my own misery.<br>
			It shouldn't be this way,<br>
			I should be able to at least run away,<br>
			From all that's making me decay.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 24-->
			When we said our goodbyes,<br>
			I finally felt free for once in my life.<br>
			Your absence gave me closure,<br>
			But I'll always treasure our friendship for sure.<br>
			It was good and bad.<br>
			But I am no longer sad.<br>
			I haven't found my peace yet.<br>
			But for now I must not fret.<br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 25-->
			My hope is restored once more.<br>
			But when will this cycle of pain end?<br>
			The thorns at my side, I must endure.<br>
			My heart and my mind, I must defend.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 26-->
			How long will you let me stay?<br>
			Please make my itch go away.<br>
			Why must I still be here?<br>
			The thought of you, I always fear.<br>
			When you are gone and I am alone,<br>
			Such is the outcome I must atone.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 27-->
			In my deepest, darkest shadow<br>
			You must never follow<br>
			If it is ever revealed<br>
			Let my fate be unsealed <br>
			All my words left unspoken<br>
			Let me be bound to it and leave me unbroken
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 28-->
			Your flame in me is rather cold<br>
			Yet it burns so fervently in my soul<br>
			I await the day you break my vessel<br>
			Our existence is too much of a hassle<br>
			Away we will vanish like the shadows<br>
			And wash ourselves with ten thousand sorrows
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 29-->
			Dreams are made, and dreams are crushed.<br>
			Reality is faced, but the truth is hidden.<br>
			Light and dark exist in the heart.<br>
			The path you choose is the fate bound to you.<br>
			Guide your soul and spirit, rise and fall like the sun and the moon.<br>
			Shine like the stars, and guard your precious life.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 30-->
			I sometimes wonder what would have been,<br>
			If our fates could bind us together like soulmates.<br>
			I sometimes wonder what would have been,<br>
			If you were alone and you reached out for me.<br>
			I sometimes wonder what would have been,<br>
			If I was your one and only shining star in the night sky.<br>
			I sometimes wonder what would have been,<br>
			If I could show my true self and if you could show me yours.<br>
			I sometimes wonder what would have been,<br>
			If our hearts can endure the flickering light of life together as one.<br>
			I sometimes wonder what would have been,<br>
			If I was in the shadows and you were my only saving grace.<br><br>

			I sometimes wonder,<br>
			If we could become closer.<br>
			But if we weren't meant for each other,<br>
			Then why did our paths still cross?<br>
			I sometimes wonder,<br>
			The moments that we shared together,<br>
			Is all I've ever cared for in this present life.<br>
			Memories of you, I will always treasure.<br>
			I sometimes wonder,<br>
			If you ever feel the same way.<br>
			Please tell me what you think and how you feel.<br>
			Please share with me your fragile heart and secret mind.<br>
			I promise to handle you with special care all the days of my life.<br>
			Keep me close and I'll keep you even closer.<br><br>

			But now I've stopped wondering,<br>
			Because the shadows have consumed my heart and my mind.<br>
			I don't want you to come in and see me.<br>
			But yet I'm in need of someone who can save me from myself.<br>
			What I see in front of me is not light at all.<br>
			Deep in my fiery pits of darkness,<br>
			Is fragility and a hollow void.<br><br>

			A small flickering light,<br>
			That little glimmer of hope,<br>
			Is the water of life that I so desperately need.<br>
			When will I know all about it?<br>
			When will I ever understand why?<br>
			When will I cheer up, or understand it all by and by?<br>
			But I hope and pray,<br>
			That one day I can finally say,<br>
			"I once was lost, but now I've been found.<br>
			I was blind, but now I can see."
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 31-->
			I feel irredeemable<br>
			All my pain is intolerable<br>
			Someone please save me from myself<br>
			I have neither fame nor wealth<br>
			I don't need any pity<br>
			Just get rid of me quickly<br>
			But if there's someone who still want me to exist<br>
			Then I will not resist<br>
			Someone please just save me from the deep dark shadows<br>
			Make my life worth living for tomorrow<br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 32-->
			Girls with an attitude problem is the least of my worries.<br>
			But falling for you will be the death of me.<br>
			Mistakes turn into blunders.<br>
			Their sharp tongues only know how to slander.<br>
			Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.<br>
			But who can find a faithful friend forever?
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 33-->
			Drenched myself in cold fire,<br>
			As I burn myself alive.<br>
			My soul is set ablaze,<br>
			As I drown myself in cold flames.<br>
			In all the chaos, can there be any peace?<br>
			Or embrace it all and just let the fire die.<br>
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!--part 34-->
			I've been wandering<br>
			Where should I have gone?<br>
			If I'm the one who's alone and lost<br><br>

			I've been wandering<br>
			Where will I go next?<br>
			If this place isn't where I belong<br><br>

			I've been wandering<br>
			Will this be my home?<br>
			I'll just go where the river flows and then I'll be on my way
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!--part 35-->
			My visions are but a blur,<br>
			Of distant memories that spur.<br>
			The fires of pain and discomfort,<br>
			And the raging floods in the desert.<br><br>

			Suppressing every disclosure,<br>
			Has led to this moment of closure.<br>
			Days of past are long gone.<br>
			Through the dark unknown, we are not alone.
