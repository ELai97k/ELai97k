		<p> <!---part 1-->
			How the rivers divide <br>
			Between you and I <br>
			How can we get by <br>
			Without a heavy sigh <br><br>
			Let the music play <br>
			Our solemn song of sorrow <br>
			Until the night fades away, we'll rise up tomorrow
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!---part 2-->
			Where have I gone wrong? <br>
			What have I done wrong? <br>
			It's not your fault, and you say it's not my fault either. <br>
			But hopefully there is, and will be, nothing lost that cannot be gained between us. <br>
			I could go on growing, or wither. <br>
			Until the day we both return to the dust.
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!---part 3-->
			Under the lonely tree, I sat down weeping for you. <br>
			My sorrows stretch out as far as a winding river. <br>
			Beyond the the horizon, it goes into the oceans of bittersweet memories yonder.
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!---part 4-->
			How I wish you were mine <br>
			But alas, this was never meant to be <br>
			My heart aches for you <br>
			I long to be closer to you still <br>
			But alas, this was never meant to be <br>
			Our forbidden love is etched in the night sky <br>
			Like the stars, it's up there but can never be reached
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!---part 5-->
			If only I could forget, <br>
			Then the pain would be bearable. <br>
			If only I'd stop much sooner, <br>
			Then my regrets would be lessened. <br>
			If only there were no bond between us, <br>
			Then there wouldn't be a heavy one-sided yoke of burdens.
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!---part 6-->
			My shining sun, my glittering star <br>
			No matter how far you are <br>
			You will always be near in my heart
		</p> <hr class="solid">
		
		<p> <!---part 7-->
			Sleep is not eternal <br>
			But my soul longs for the inferno <br>
			Away into the dead of night <br>
			I collapsed under the sheer weight of the fist fight <br>
			When I awoke in the heavenly stardom <br>
			I have finally achieved enlightenment in my freedom
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!---part 8-->
			Was is all worth it? <br>
			Only for you to leave and never return? <br>
			Across the endless oceans, will you forget me? <br>
			I may be uable to keep you close, but my heart still longs for warmth and embrace. <br>
			Yet it always remains firm and strong amidst chaos and destruction. <br>
			Time does not wait for anyone, it has no regard for human sorrows and goodbyes. <br>
			Even if our fated end comes, the universe goes on, without a care for mere mortals. <br>
			We are but fickle shadows doomed to live and die.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!---part 9-->
			I was a fool to put too much faith in you, <br>
			Only for you to receive but never give back. <br>
			But it wasn't you who broke me. <br>
			I broke myself to pieces, and had to repair and rebuild. <br>
			But in the reflections of the broken glasses, I saw all my faults and wrongs. <br>
			So I put myself back, but I'm still broken and fragile, as I've always been. <br>
			Scars and cracks won't go away, but the heart continues to beat. <br>
			Until the day it stops.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!---part 10-->
			My heart is heavy <br>
			I'm unable to see what's in front of me <br>
			But one thing I can see <br>
			Is your reflection etched into the deep sea
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!---part 11-->
			Up high on the mountain top, <br>
			I saw my world below me. <br>
			Life goes on. <br>
			People eat, drink, and be merry. <br>
			Life is a dreary thought, so I flew away. <br>
			Reaching out for the heavens, never to return again.
		</p> <hr class="solid">

		<p> <!---part 11-->
			When the storm fades away tonight. <br>
			A new light of hope will dawn upon us. <br>
			But only if we face the deep dark abyss. <br>
			What will become of us if we come out alive? <br>
			Joy? Or even more grief and despair? <br>
			Or can happiness ever be achieved? <br>
			Until the bitter end of our lives, we must continue to stand strong, <br>
			in the deep dark abyss.
