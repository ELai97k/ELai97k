			<b>Verse 1:</b> <br>
            Why did I dream of you, <br>
			When we were so close, but yet so far. <br><br>

            <b>Pre-chorus:</b> <br>
			What if I said I miss you? <br>
			Am I weak, or do I just want back those days. <br>
			Those bygone days when we were still together. <br><br>

            <b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Now I wish I was gone, so that I could forget. <br>
			All the pain and sorrow I brought.<br>
			Even if I am alone and gone, <br>
			I want you to be happy and blessed without me. <br>
			Without me, please be happy and blessed. <br><br>

            <b>Verse 2:</b> <br>
			No matter how pleasant the dream, <br>
			I would wake up lonely and empty. <br>
			The stars are no longer aligned for you and me. <br>
			But I wish that I could forget it all and be gone. <br><br>

            <b>Pre-chorus:</b> <br>
			What if I said I miss you? <br>
			Am I weak, or do I just want back those days. <br>
			Those bygone days when we were still together. <br><br>

            <b>Chrous:</b> <br>
			Now I wish I was gone, so that I could forget. <br>
			All the pain and sorrow I brought. <br>
			Even if I am alone and gone, <br>
			I want you to be happy and blessed without me. <br>
			Without me, please be happy and blessed. <br><br>

            <b>Bridge:</b> <br>
			Maybe it's better if I just die alone. <br>
			It would be best if I just disappeared and be gone. <br>
			I will definitely miss you. <br>
			Even if that makes me weak, I can never get back those days. <br>
			Those bygone days when we were still together. <br><br>

            <b>Chorus 2:</b> <br>
			I wish that I am gone, so that I can forget. <br>
			All the pain and sorrow I brought. <br>
			When I am alone and gone, <br>
			I want you to be happy and blessed without me. <br>
			Without me, please be happy and blessed.

			<b>V1:</b> <br>
			He who watches over me is in control<br>
			He knows my name and my sorrows untold<br>
			With the thorns at my side<br>
			I still continue to fight<br><br>

			<b>V2:</b> <br>
			He who suffered for me believes that I can endure<br>
			How much more will I in Him be secure<br>
			With the thorns at my side<br>
			I still continue to fight<br><br>

			<b>V3:</b> <br>
			He watches over me with His divine protection<br>
			He will see my life to its full completion<br>
			With the thorns at my side<br>
			I still continue to fight

			<b class="text">Life Is A Pain, What's There To Gain</b><br><br>
			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone. <br><br>

			<b>Verse 1:</b> <br>
			Life is sad, full of storms and doubts. <br>
			Ambitions turn to dust, and anxiety is king on the throne. <br>
			Goals are met, dreams are realised. <br>
			But what's it all for? <br>
			All for nothing. <br>
			Because one day, we will fade away, never to return again. <br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone. <br><br>

			<b>Verse 2:</b> <br>
			Dream a little dream of me. <br>
			One thing we all need, is true love and genuine care. <br>
			We need love, we need life. <br>
			So that we can go on together. <br>
			And so that the pain would be more bearable. <br>
			But at the end of the day, the truth still remains. <br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone. <br><br>

			<b>Bridge:</b> <br>
			My heart just keeps getting sadder and sadder. <br>
			If only there was a cure to make me feel better. <br>
			A glad heart makes a happy face, but a broken heart crushes the spirit. <br>
			The human spirit can endure in sickness, but who can bear a crushed spirit? <br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone.

			<b class="text">Missing Shots</b><br><br>
			<b>Verse 1:</b> <br>
			I've missed my shots<br>
			For far too long<br>
			I've been standing still<br>
			Unable to think and feel<br>
			Everything around me was just a blur<br><br>

			<b>Verse 2:</b> <br>
			I've missed my shots<br>
			For far too long<br>
			I've always wanted someone beside me<br>
			Friends come and go, leaving me empty<br>
			But I've taken my stand, and with my hands<br>
			I take charge of my own strength<br>
			But I know, deep down inside, I won't be alone<br><br>

			<b>Pre-chorus:</b> <br>
			I've missed my shots<br>
			Missed my marks<br>
			But I know, I can always try again<br>
			I can always rise if I fall<br>
			Against all odds, if all else fails<br>
			I'll find another way, forge my own path<br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			I've missed my shots<br>
			How long more must I wait<br>
			For you to come to me<br>
			What if you and I, take our stand<br>
			Against all odds, and if all else fails<br>
			I will let you go, but I won't forget you<br><br>

			<b>Bridge:</b> <br>
			I've missed my shots<br>
			But in the final days<br>
			I hope you remember me<br>
			Though I've failed again and again<br>
			What I found out was<br>
			My shots weren't wasted at all<br>
			I hope I've made my marks in the hearts of all<br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			I've missed my shots<br>
			How long more must I wait<br>
			For you to come to me<br>
			What if you and I, take our stand<br>
			Against all odds, and if all else fails<br>
			I will let you go, but I won't forget you
