			<b>Verse 1:</b> <br>
            Why did I dream of you, <br>
			When we were so close, but yet so far. <br><br>

            <b>Pre-chorus:</b> <br>
			What if I said I miss you? <br>
			Am I weak, or do I just want back those days. <br>
			Those bygone days when we were still together. <br><br>

            <b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Now I wish I was gone, so that I could forget. <br>
			All the pain and sorrow I brought.<br>
			Even if I am alone and gone, <br>
			I want you to be happy and blessed without me. <br>
			Without me, please be happy and blessed. <br><br>

            <b>Verse 2:</b> <br>
			No matter how pleasant the dream, <br>
			I would wake up lonely and empty. <br>
			The stars are no longer aligned for you and me. <br>
			But I wish that I could forget it all and be gone. <br><br>

            <b>Pre-chorus:</b> <br>
			What if I said I miss you? <br>
			Am I weak, or do I just want back those days. <br>
			Those bygone days when we were still together. <br><br>

            <b>Chrous:</b> <br>
			Now I wish I was gone, so that I could forget. <br>
			All the pain and sorrow I brought. <br>
			Even if I am alone and gone, <br>
			I want you to be happy and blessed without me. <br>
			Without me, please be happy and blessed. <br><br>

            <b>Bridge:</b> <br>
			Maybe it's better if I just die alone. <br>
			It would be best if I just disappeared and be gone. <br>
			I will definitely miss you. <br>
			Even if that makes me weak, I can never get back those days. <br>
			Those bygone days when we were still together. <br><br>

            <b>Chorus 2:</b> <br>
			I wish that I am gone, so that I can forget. <br>
			All the pain and sorrow I brought. <br>
			When I am alone and gone, <br>
			I want you to be happy and blessed without me. <br>
			Without me, please be happy and blessed.

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			I want to fly, so very high and touch the sky. <br>
			I want to reach for Your hand and everlasting arms. <br>
			For I am Yours, and Lord God, You are mine. <br>
			I want to lift Your name up like a banner in the sky. <br>
			You're higher.

			<b class="text">Untitled Song</b><br><br>
			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone. <br><br>

			<b>Verse 1:</b> <br>
			Life is sad, full of storms and doubts. <br>
			Ambitions turn to dust, and anxiety is king on the throne. <br>
			Goals are met, dreams are realised. <br>
			But what's it all for? <br>
			All for nothing. <br>
			Because one day, we will fade away, never to return again. <br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone. <br><br>

			<b>Verse 2:</b> <br>
			Dream a little dream of me. <br>
			One thing we all need, is true love and genuine care. <br>
			We need love, we need life. <br>
			So that we can go on together. <br>
			And so that the pain would be more bearable. <br>
			But at the end of the day, the truth still remains. <br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone. <br><br>

			<b>Bridge:</b> <br>
			My heart just keeps getting sadder and sadder. <br>
			If only there was a cure to make me feel better. <br>
			A glad heart makes a happy face, but a broken heart crushes the spirit. <br>
			The human spirit can endure in sickness, but who can bear a crushed spirit? <br><br>

			<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
			Life is a pain, what's there to gain? <br>
			People come and go, without a trace. <br>
			Soon, everyone disappears, and you'll be left alone.
